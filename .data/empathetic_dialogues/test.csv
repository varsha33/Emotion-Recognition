So she bought some and brought it to me. How nice of her to do that!That was nice! What does Scottish cheese taste like?This particular one was a cheddar and it tends to be from smaller producers and is creamier and more flavorful than the cheeses we typically get here.Cheddar is one of my favorites. I live pretty close to Cabot Creamery and I love their sharp cheddar.Ooh, I haven't tried Cabot. Must look out for it. The cheddar I normally get is from Tillamook. I think it's from Oregon. Where's Cabot from?It's located in a small farming town in Vermont. I went on a tour of their factory once and it was interesting to see the cheese being made.I've never done that. Wonder if there's a cheese factory near me.
