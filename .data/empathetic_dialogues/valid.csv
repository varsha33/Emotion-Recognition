She had been shopping and had also found the perfect dress.  She took it out of the bag to show me and I discovered it was the same dress!! Couldnt believe it.  Oh how I resented her at that moment.[SPLIT]That's very intense. I am sorry you had to experience that.[SPLIT]Oh if envy could kill - she would have been dead on the spot.
